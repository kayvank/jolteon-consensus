** TODO create project :rust:
*** TODO github CI
*** packages [5/9]:consensus:
**** DONE crypto :consensus:
create the project, add unit tests. The crypto package will do:
+ signature
+ key generation
**** DONE store
Used for persistence. For this part, we'll use embedded key-value store.
Neither nix nor Ubuntu's,  RockDB built were successful.
For now I opted out to using [[https://www.redb.org/][redb]]
**** DONE network
**** DONE mempool
**** DONE consensus
There is a test in the synchronizer_tests.rs that is commented out for now.
The test requires the committee TCP receiver to be up.
Running the tests, with logging configured shows the repeated attempt to synchronize for the
missing block-parent. This indicates this specific test is doing what is required to do.
**** TODO node
**** TODO benchmark
**** TODO docs, readme :doc:

*** TODO update rand :pkgupdate:
*** TODO update db for rocks-db :pkgupdate:
